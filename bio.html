        <h1> BIOGRAPHY</h1>        
        <h3> About the collection.</h3>
        <p>The images in this collection are all related to the ill-fated development of a mobile game called Arrow, not to be confused with the television show of the same name which set the standard for gritty realism-based superhero shows but then inexplicitly decided to give up on middling along for a couple of years before that before finally being completely destroyed by poor writing, something that the quality of this biography shows that I am clearly an expert in. </p>
        <p>Arrow was a mobile phone game, targeted for both android and apple devices that began development as a college project in 2014. Oddly enough the game was actually inspired by the lemmings games, though the gameplay actually was nothing like the lemmings games. By the time development started the game had evolved into an a dungeon crawler type game where layer, a lone ranger (no relation) had to escape various levels using just your agility and a single arrow.  The game was developed over a period of six months before a trip to E32015 and being subsequently abandoned by the summer of the same year. </p>
